### My Nerd Pals' Ratings for Next Generation Episodes
***

Listen: my friends built a spreadsheet with their ratings all by their onesies. This thing had some amazing stats like 
red shirt deaths, combat styles, aliens, and whether or not bangin' happened in the episode. Rather than let them toil alone
I though I'd help them automate and visualize some of this stuff. 

I'll be using some Neo4J as the database and using Flask for the backend. I'll keep coming back to this thing
so I'll throw in React and some other D3 goodies at some point.
